# CLIntercept

A simple lightweight tool to intercept incoming and outgoing HTTP packets using HTTP proxy to view, modify and edit them. It's extremely useful for quick tests and modifications on HTTP requests and responses without needing to load heavy tools like Burp or ZAP. 

# Why?

Well, it's not optimal for complex works but it's extremely useful for quick modification needs for example when you're exploring a webpage and you get curious if it's vulnerable to some bug so you can run CLIntercept using a simple command instead of waiting for Burp Suite to load. Or when you need to debug something really quick. Anyway, here are some advantages of CLIntercept over other tools:
1. Simple and begginer-friendly
2. Fast
3. Lightweight
4. Written in raw Python with as less as dependencies possible
